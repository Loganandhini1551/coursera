				<h2>Sushi</h2>
				<p>Sushi is known for having high amounts of concentrated forms of omega-3 fatty acids. This is perhaps the most sought after and cited benefit of sushi. These fatty acids act as a “good” form of cholesterol that helps to prevent clogged arteries. Omega-3 has also been linked to helping lower blood pressure. The types of sushi that are especially rich in omega-3 include lake trout, herring, tuna, and salmon. Sushi is known for having high amounts of concentrated forms of omega-3 fatty acids.
