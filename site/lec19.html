Okay, so here I am in Sublime Text and I'm looking at the file called background-before.html and it's located in the examples, Lecture20 folder. And the structure of this HTML document is pretty simple. 
</div>
<p>elephant is favourite animal</p>
</body>
<style>
	*{color:red;}
	div{background-color: blue;
	     color:purple;
	     width: 300px;
	     border:20px solid black;
	     padding:40px;
	     margin:20px;
	     height:100px;
	     box-sizing: content-box;
	     overflow:scroll;}
	     p{background-color: green;
	     	color:red;
	     	width:300px;
	     	border:30px;
	     	padding:30px;
	     	margin:60px;
	     	box-sizing: border-box;
